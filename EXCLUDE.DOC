o What is Exclude

    The Exclude program is used to  erase inbound  messages received from
  systems  you don't  want to  receive mail  from. The  exclusion process
  is based upon keywords contained within the systems name, as defined in
  the Nodelist, and by the systems Nodelist Flags.
 
o Why is Exclude

    As FidoNet standardizes and grows  in both  complexity and  in scope,
  the need  to  exclude inbound  mail from undesirable  systems will also
  grow. The standardization  of the Nodelist Flags  makes  this exclusion
  possible as an  automated process.  By invoking  Exclude  automatically
  when your  system receives  mail, your  system can erase  the undesired
  messages without your ever having to see them.

o How does it work

    You maintain a configuration file which contains keywords to look for
  and  known  system addresses  to exclude.  The configuration  file also
  contains the directory names of message areas you want  Exclude to look
  through.  As  an option in  the  configuration  file,  your  system can
  generate an  immediate reply  to the  excluded system  offering a short
  note that the  message  was  intercepted and  erased. A  log is kept of
  erased message  files  detailing  who the  message was from, why it was
  excluded, and the subject of the message.

o The Command Line Options

  /h                    Offers help information and then exits.

  /s                    Displays the log file information on
                        messages that were excluded.

  /d                    Displays a list of all systems that are
                        to be excluded and shows why they were
                        selected to be excluded. The exclusion
                        may have been due to a Nodelist Flag,
                        a pre-defined network address, or due to
                        a keyword (in which case the keyword
                        that triggered the exclusion is
                        offered).

  /c <filename>         Compiles the exclusion data file by
                        scanning the nodelist offered by
                        <filename>.

    No command  line option  will cause  Exclude  to scan  the configured
  message directories for  mail from  the excluded systems and will erase
  any found, optionally sending a reply message to the excluded system.

o Details

    At  compile  time, where  most of the  work  is done,  a file  called
  EXCLUDE.BAD is created which  contains information on all systems to be
  excluded. During the compile, each address  is displayed along with the
  reason of why it was selected to be excluded.

    At mail scanning time, when  a message  is erased,  information about
  the originating system, the subject, and the reason why it was excluded
  is appended to the log file:  EXCLUDE.LOG.  This file is displayed with
  the /s command line option and is ASCII format.

    Optional immediate reply's are generated by creating a new message in
  the mail  directory  where the  excluded  message  was  erased  in. The
  'Message From' field is described as 'Exclude'.  The 'Message To' field
  is set to the name of the originally erased mail  'Message From' field.
  The subject is retained.

    You may define text to be appended to  the reply message by using the
  'text' keyword  in the  configuration file. If none are defined in that
  configuration file, default messages are offered.

    The default message  text offers a  three-line  message  that  may be
  either one of these texts:

    Exclude V1.0 intercepted above message and then erased it.
    Destination node reason:
       Nodelist flag exclusion

    Exclude V1.0 intercepted above message and then erased it.
    Destination node reason:
       Originating systems name was excluded

    Exclude V1.0 intercepted above message and then erased it.
    Destination node reason:
       Pre-defined network address exclusion

    The reply message generated is marked as 'Immediate' and as 'Direct',
  to insure that it  gets sent and that  your system does  not attempt to
  route it through the network.

o Conflicts of exclusion selection

    If a system you wish to receive mail from has a nodelist flag you use
  to select exclusions with or a keyword in its title you use to exclude,
  you can place a 'known' entry in the configuration file followed by a -
  sign and  then the  network  address. When the  compiler encounters the
  node  with the undesired  keyword or  flag in it, the node will  not be
  added to the list of excluded systems.

o Mutual Excluding Systems

    If your system excludes mail from another  and generates an immediate
  reply, a  problem could arise if the  other system also  excludes yours
  and generates an  immediate reply. In this event, the two systems would
  continually call each other with the reply message.

    Exclude will not allow this to happen because if it sees that a reply
  message from another system running Exclude has come in, the message is
  erased, logged to the log file, and no automatic reply will be sent.

o The Distribution File

  EXCLUDE.ZIP contains the following files:

    o EXCLUDE.EXE - The executable file
    o EXCLUDE.C   - Turbo C 2.0 source code
    o EXCLUDE.CFG - Sample configuration file
    o EXCLUDE.DOC - This document file

    For updates to the program, the magic name 'EXCLUDE' can be requested
  from   the   authors  system  at  1:102/901.0,  in  California.  It  is
  distributed  freely, is  not to  be  sold, and  the  author  assumes no
  liability for its use or misuse.
